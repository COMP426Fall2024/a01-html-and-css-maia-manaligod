                    Each kingdom has it's own challenges, as well as it's corresponding guardian goddess. Other deities

                    <h2>First Hour: The Watercourse of Ra</h2>
                    <p><strong>The goddess Sau, the Smiter of Heads and Enemies of Ra</strong>, protects Ra's body throughout the first night.
                        She defended the boat against six fire breathing snakes. The wolf headed war god Wepwawet guides the boat.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Second Hour: Ouranos</h2>
            <p><strong>The Wise Protector of Her Lord</strong> takes over and guides the boat. This is where dead kings live. 
                Egyptian deities such as Bes, the dwarf god, and Nepra, the god of grain, live here. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Third Hour: Watercourse of the Only God</h2>
            <p><strong>She Who Slices Souls</strong> leads the boat through Amentent, the kingdom of Osiris. This is the where the 
                dead undergo Judgement. Each of Horus' 4 sons assist in protecting a different set of organs.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Fourth Hour: Living One of Forms</h2>
            <p><strong>Great in Her Powers</strong> is the protector for the fourth hour. This region is the domain of Sokar, a variation of Osiris. 
                As the River of Night disappears and turns into a ravine called the Mouth of the Tomb, the goddess transforms the 
                boat into a great serprent and traverses the region.

                <h2>Fifth Hour: Hidden</h2>
                <p> <strong>She Who is in Her Boat</strong> guides the boat through another region ruled by Sokar.
                    Sokar punishes rebellious souls while protexting Khepera - The Great Soul, the beetle 
                    that will assist in the re-birth of Ra. The far wall of kingdom, where Khepera resides,
                    the Realm of Night and Darkness.  
                </p>
                <p>Khepera joins the boat for the remainder of the journey.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Sixth Hour: Abyss of Waters</h2>
            <p>The sixth goddess, <strong>Proficient Leader</strong>, transforms the serpent back into a boat as 
                the River of Night reappears. As the boat sails, mystical creatures and mysterious shapes
                stand on the river banks and sing praises to Ra. Khepera is placed on the head of Ra. 
                The boat begins to move to sunrise.  
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Seventh Hour: The Secret Cavern</h2>
            <p><strong>She Who Repels the Forces of Chaos and Decapitates the Savage Faced</strong> protects Ra througout the seventh region.
                This is where the boat faces Apophis, the serpent of evil and chaos. Apophis wishes to kill Ra
                and destroy the world.
            </p>
            <p>Numerous gods come to defend Ra.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Isis, the goddess of Magic, creates the serpent Mehen to protect.</li>
                <li>Selket, the goddess of the dead, assists in the attack.</li>
                <li>Her-desuf, a variation of Horus the sky god, attacks as well.
                    <p>note: In some versions, this god is Set, the god of chaos and destruction</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Even though they battle, Aphophis is never killed, only wounded. Apophis is only sufficiently weakened for Isis
                to seal him away for another night. </p>
                <p>The boat sails on and is ready to transition into the day.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Eighth Hour: the Sarcophagus of the Gods</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Coffer of Her Deities</strong> leads the boat through this region. Dead gods of Egypt dwell here, shouting praises
                and prayers to Ra. The boat is followed by a procession of a group called
                the Nine Followers of the Gods. The four rams known as Tanaten march ahead of the boat. They collectively represent 
                Tatenen, a genderless primordial earth god.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Ninth Hour: The Procession of Images</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Wise Protector of Her Lord</strong> guides the boat through rough waters while more gods since praises of Ra. 
                The dead live in this region and receive offerings made by the living.  
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Tenth Hour: Abyss of Waters, Lofty of Banks</h2>
            <p>In this region, the boat is guided by <strong>The Raging One, Who Boils the Rebel Alive.</strong> 
                More dwellers and warriors appear to welcome Ra. Four goddesses appear and lighten the way, 
                signalizing the first rays of sunlight. The Morningstar, a two-headed snake with legs, protects Ra from enemies. 
            </p>
            <p>Khepera the beetle fuses with the soul of Ra, but he has not been revived yet.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Eleventh Hour: the Mouth of the Cavern</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Instructor, Lady of the Sacred Boat, at Whose Emergence the Rebels are Punished</strong> takes control. The snake Mehen tows the Boat
                forward. This region is where sinners are punished.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Twelfth Hour: Darkness has Fallen and Births Shine Forth</h2>
            <p>The twelfth goddess, <strong>Who Sees the Beauty of Ra</strong>, guides the boat through the last kingdom. This region is the body of a serpent 
                known as the Life of the Gods - not a physical place. Twelve worshippers
                tow the boat to the end. Here, Khepera awakes the soul and Ra is reborn as Khepri. The old body of Ra is through out of the ship, 
                and the ship sails out of the mouth of the serpent and emerges from the mountain of Bhaku for sunrise.
