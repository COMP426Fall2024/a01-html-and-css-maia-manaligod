        <h1>The Twelve Kingdoms of the Night</h1>

    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Ra's body, recently deceased, is protected as it travels through the 12 kingdoms of the night.
            Each kingdom has it's own challenges, as well as it's corresponding guardian goddess. Other deities
            assist in protecting Ra as well.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>First Hour</h2>
        <p>The goddess Sau, the Smiter of Heads and Enemies of Ra, protected Ra's body throughout the first night.
            She defended the boat against six fire breathing snakes.  </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Second Hour</h2>
        <p>The Wise Protector of Her Lord takes over and guides the boat. This region is where the shades of those who died reside. 
            Egyptian deities such as Bes, the dwarf god, and Nepra, the god of grain, live here. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Third Hour</h2>
        <p>She Who Slices Souls leads the boat through Amentent, the kingdom of Osiris. This is the where the 
            dead undergo Judgement. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Fourth Hour</h2>
        <p>Great in Her Powers is the protector for the fourth hour. This region is the domain of Sokar, a variation of Osiris. 
            As the River of Night disappears, the goddess transforms the boat into a great serprent and traverses the region.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Fifth Hour</h2>
        <p> She Who is in Her Boat guides the boat through another region ruled by Sokar.
            Sokar punishes rebellious souls while protexting Khepera - The Great Soul, the beetle 
            that will assist in the re-birth of Ra. Khepera resides the Realm of Night and Darkness.  
        </p>
        <p>Khepera joins the boat for the remainder of the journey.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Sixth Hour</h2>
        <p>The sixth goddess, Proficient Leader, transforms the serpent back into a boat as 
            the River of Night reappears. As the boat sails, mystical creatures and mysterious shapes
            stand on the river banks and sing praises to Ra. Khepera is placed on the head of Ra. 
            The boat will begin to move to sunrise.  
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Seventh Hour</h2>
        <p>She Who Repels the Forces of Chaors and Decapitates the Savage Faced protects Ra througout the seventh region.
            This is where the boat faces Apophis, the serpent of evil and chaos. Apophis wishes to kill Ra
            and destroy the world.
        </p>
        <p>Numerous gods come to defend Ra.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Isis, the goddess of Magic, creates the serpent Mehen to protect Ra against the attacks.</li>
            <li>Selket, the goddess of the dead, assists in the attack.</li>
            <li>Her-desuf, a variation of Horus the sky god, attacks as well.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even though they battle, Aphophis is never killed, only wounded. The boat sails on and is ready to transition into the day.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Eighth Hour</h2>
        <p>The Coffer of Her Deities leads the boat through this region. Dead gods of Egypt dwell here, shouting praises
            and prayers to Ra. The boat is followed by a procession of a group called
            the Nine Followers of the Gods. The four rams known as Tanaten march ahead of the boat. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Ninth Hour</h2>
        <p>The Wise Protector of Her Lord guides the boat through rough waters while more gods since praises of Ra. 
            The dead live in this region and receive offerings made by the living.  
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Tenth Hour</h2>
        <p>In this region, the boat is guided by The Raging One, Who Boils the Rebel Alive. 
            More dwellers and warriors appear to welcome Ra. Four goddesses appear and lighten the way, 
            signalizing the first rays of sunlight. The Morningstar, a two-headed snake with legs, protects Ra from enemies. 
        </p>
        <p>Khepera the beetle fuses with the soul of Ra, but he has not been revived yet.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Eleventh Hour</h2>
        <p>The Instructor, Lady of the Sacred Boat, at Whose Emergence the Rebels are Punished takes control. The snake Mehen tows the Boat
            forward. This region is where sinners are punished. Atum (a version of Ra) watches over the boat and guides the boat with a breeze. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Twelfth Hour</h2>
        <p>The twelfth goddess, Who Sees the Beauty of Ra, guides the boat through the last kingdom. This region takes 
            place in the body of a serpent known as the Life of the Gods - not a physical place. Twelve worshippers
            tow the boat to the end. Here, Khepera awakes the soul and Ra is reborn as Khepri. The old body of Ra is through out of the ship, 
            and the ship sails out of the mouth of the serpent and emerges from the mountain of Bhaku for sunrise.
