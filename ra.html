            <h1>Ra: The Sun God</h1>   
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <p>The sun god Ra is ancient Egypt's most revered and sacred deity. He was worshipped as the king of the gods 
                and the father of creation. 
            </p>
            <p>note: Although Ra is the main sun god, here is a list of other contenders 
                for Egyptian sun gods include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Aten the sun disk became more worshipped than Ra under the rule of Akhenaten.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Amun wasn't a sun god until he was fused with Ra to become Amun-Ra.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Horus was a sky god who was, on occasion, fused with Ra as well.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>His human form was normally depicted with the head of a falcon wearing a sun disc. Other symbols included: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>a scarab beatle</li>
                <li>a ram</li>
                <li>a man</li>
                <li>the sun itself</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Ra Spawned All Life</h2>
            <p>According to many Egyptian myths, Ra created all life.</p>
            <p>Out of eternal darkness, and entity called Atum called forth the beginning of creation. An island
                emerged out of the Primeval Ocean, which turned into Ra, the sun god. Ra spawned the first gods:

                <tr>
                    <th>God</th>
                    <th>Domain</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Shu</td>
                    <td>Air</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Tefnut</td>
                    <td>Humidity</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Geb</td>
                    <td>Earth</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Nut</td>
                    <td>Sky</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Geb and Nut would go on to birth Osiris, the Perfect Being, who became
                ruler of the world. 
            </p>
            <p>Ra created the elements, and produced humans from the tears of his eyes. 
                As the creator of the universe, Ra became father and king to all gods, humans,
                and living creatures.

            <h2>The Eye of Ra</h2>
            <p>The eye of Ra, not to be confused with Ra himself, was the god's geminine counterpart - sometimes described as his 
                daughter, wife, or mother. It was an extention of Ra's power that was associated with several goddesses including
                Bastet, Ma'at, and Sekhmet, each of which had a role in protecting Ra from external
                evil forces.
