                <h1>The Greek Underworld</h1>
                <p>The earliest idea of afterlife in Greek Myth is that, at the moment of death, an individual's essense is separated from the corpse and transported to the underworld.</p>

                <h1>The Journey's Beginning</h1>
                <h3><em>don't forget your coin!</em></h3>
                <p>As a soul enters the Underworld, the ferryman Charon guides them across the River Styx. 
                    But this is not done for free. The soul is expected to pay Charon a coin, which would be obtained
                    if one was places over the eye or under the tongue of their physical body in the living world. 
                    Those without payment are said to be left at the shores for 100 years.</p>

                <h1>Judgement</h1>
                <p>The underworld judges, Rhadamanthus and Minos, would determine where in the Underworld the soul would reside. 
                    There are three main places in the Underworld where a soul could go.</p>
