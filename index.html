                <h1>The Journey of Ra</h1>
                <p>In Egyptian myth, the sun god Ra makes a daily journey through the underworld, spanning from sunset in 
                    the west and sunrise in the east. The journey is associated with the imagery of continual death
                    and rebirth - the sun "dies" as it sets and is "reborn" when it rises. </p>
                <p>Many Egyptian deities assist Ra through this journey as he sails through the 12 kingdoms of day and 12 kingdoms of night. </p>

                <h1>The Day</h1>
                <p>As he moves throughout his journey, Ra undergoes three transformations: </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Khepri</h3>
                        <p>Represented as a scarab beetle, Khepri symbolizes the newly-born sun of dawn in the mornings.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Ra</h3>
                        <p>In the afternoons, he becomes a young man with a falcon head. This is the form most people know.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Atum</h3>
                        <p>In the evening, he transforms into Atum - an old man with a cane.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul> 

            <div>
                <p>Throughout the day, he travels through 12 kingdoms of solar deities.</p>

            <div>
                <p>At the end of the day, he is swallowed by the sky goddess Nut and travels through the Underworld to be reborn again.</p>

            <h1>The Night</h1>
                <p> The Afterlife is divided into 12 regions, each guarded by a gate.
                    As the day turns to night and Ra lays dead, his body is taken care of the 12 goddesses of the night, as well as other deities.
                    
                </p>
