                    <p>In Egyptian myth, the sun Ra sails on his barque across the sky. During the day, he is the sun. During the night, his body sails 
                        through the 12 kingdoms of the underworld. In Egyptian belief, the two mountains Baku (in the East) and Manu (in the West), were the exit and entry points of the underworld.</p>
            
                    <p>The journey is associated with the imagery of continual death and rebirth - the sun "dies" as it sets and is "reborn" when it rises. </p>
                    <p>Many Egyptian deities assist Ra through this journey as he sails through the 12 kingdoms of day and 12 kingdoms of night. </p>
